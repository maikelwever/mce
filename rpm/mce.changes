* Wed May 11 2011 Mika Laitio <ext-mika.laitio@nokia.com> - 1.10.92-14

  screen lock ui active or not when handling the power button
  event. Patch is made to updated version of

- reorganized the order how patches are applied on spec file
  as 2 of the patches touches same tklock file

* Wed May 11 2011 Timo Rongas <timo.rongas@digia.com> - 1.10.92-13
- Added ofono signal listening to call state module. Knowing call
  state makes it possible to enable screen blanking/locking via

* Wed May 11 2011 Mika Laitio <ext-mika.laitio@nokia.com> - 1.10.92-12
- BMC#17413 fix with patch
  mce-1.10.92-fix-n900-tsc2005-sysfs-disable-path-for-newer-kernels.patch.
  Sysfs path for disabling/enabling the touschreen has changed in
  newer kernels for N900 to /sys/devices/platform/omap2_mcspi.1/spi1.0/disable
  This patch will make mce to check both the new and old path for finding
  the correct sysfs file path.

* Mon May 09 2011 Mika Laitio <ext-mika.laitio@nokia.com> - 1.10.92-11
- BMC#15953 Changed the behaviour of power key in unlock case.
  When the screen is off(blank) and power key is pressed, screen is unblanked
  but the "lock ui" application is not disabled. Lock key will work just
  like with the previous version, so it will unblank the screen and
  also disable the lock ui application.

* Fri May 06 2011 Mika Laitio <ext-mika.laitio@nokia.com> - 1.10.92-10
- When the device is booted, the initial blanking delay needs to be
  longer to prevent the display to be blanked during the device
  boot-up or immediately after that.
- Simplified mce-1.10.92-pwr-btn-fix-for-display-blank-and-unblank.patch
  by taking out MCE_DISPLAY_TOGGLE related code that this patch
  added, because it was not needed anymore.

* Thu May 05 2011 Mika Laitio <ext-mika.laitio@nokia.com> - 1.10.92-9
- (BMC#15953) Fixed the usage of lock key for locking the screen.
- Fixedthe power button usage for blanking the screen to follow the
  same behaviour with lock/unlock key.
  When the screen is now blanked, it can not be activated anymore
  by simply touching the touchscreen. Instead the user can unblank
  the display either by using the power button or lock/unlock button again.
- The power button will now blank/unblank the screen after release event
  instead of press-event. This will allow user to see the shutdown
  ui, in the case user keeps power button down for a long time in order
  to shutdown the device.
- increased the blanking timeout during inactivity from 30 to 60 sec

* Mon Apr 18 2011 Mika Laitio <ext-mika.laitio@nokia.com> - 1.10.92-8
- (BMC#16313) Added dependency from mce to dsme because mce fails to start
  if dsme is not running.

* Thu Apr 07 2011 Mika Laitio <ext-mika.laitio@nokia.com> - 1.10.92-7
- (BMC#15233) Added MCE_DISPLAY_TOGGLE value to mce.h and and
  send TOGGLE request from the power button keypreses in the event-input.c.
  Added also the code to meegodisplay.c to handle these display toggle requests.

* Wed Apr 06 2011 Mika Laitio <ext-mika.laitio@nokia.com> - 1.10.92-6
- (BMC#14738) Additional fix. Sometimes the screen got invoked couple of
  seconds after blanking it even thought there were not any user activity.
  This was caused by the code in event-input.c which suspended the event
  reading for a while in certain situations after sending the activity
  event. I removed the suspend code and instead use the input events time
  as a filter so that only one activity event is send in maximum on each
  second from the touchscreen events.

* Mon Apr 04 2011 Mika Laitio <ext-mika.laitio@nokia.com> - 1.10.92-5
- (BMC#14738) Add new displaymeego module which simplifies the display blanking
  code that was used in display module by removing all dimming related
  functionality that's not needed and had problems.
- Drop previously used display-module-disabled patch

* Wed Mar 09 2011 Tapio Rantala <ext-tapio.rantala@nokia.com> - 1.10.92-4

  + Added event driver name for the power button in various MeeGo devices
